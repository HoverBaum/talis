# About

Talis is a dice rolling app developed to support multiple games or configurations of dice. It currently supports Shadowrun and D6 dice.

It's a hobby project of mine. You can find it OpenSource on [GitHub](https://github.com/HoverBaum/talis). I started this as a side project to relax, let's see where it will go.
