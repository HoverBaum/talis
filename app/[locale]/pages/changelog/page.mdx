# Changelog

## 2026-02-16 (1.9.0) Sidebar options 🎨

You can now choose between three version of the options in the sidebar. From full on language, theme and mode over a compact version to nothing.

Head to the settings page to configure your preference.

## 2026-01-28 (1.8.0) new settings page 🎨

The settings page has been re-designed for clarity and now supports or a more visual theme selection.

## 2026-01-06 (1.7.0) Coin "Roller" 🪙

You can now use Talis for Coin flips.

In the Coin "Roller" you have a number of default coins to flip (like heads/tails) and can add your own. You can also decide on the colors used with more options than our rollers offered so far.

Also: the Home page changed to accomodate the growing amount of rollers. We also added an icon to each roller. These icons represent a rollers core mechanic - there might be multiple rollers sharing the same icon in the future.

## 2025-12-15 (1.6.0) New Dice select wheel ✨

The wheel used to select dice amounts got a visual and haptic overhaul. Enjoy 😊

## 2025-12-14 Cache Clearing 🔥

To help user mitigate potential issue from config persistance, user now have the option to clear their cache in the About page. This will delete all roller related configs.

Important: to make this happen we had to trigger this once for everyone. You will have to re-create your configs.

## 2025-12-12 Polyedric dice in Daggerheart 🎲

The daggerheart Roller now directly supports polyedric dice. Now you can roll for damage without swithing to another roller.

🐛 we also fixed a small layout shift issue with the polyedric roller.

## 2025-11-26 Polyhedral roller ⚔️

A new roller that supports classical, polyhedric dice - as found in e.g. Dungeons and Dragons.

- Support d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 and d100
- For each dice type you can set an amount via scroll wheel
- The wheel for each dice can be configured
- OUr usual options like sorting and sums are supported

## 2025-11-25 Daggerheart and more design 🎨

The Daggerheart roller is now out of beta.

- Theme colors can be used for hope and fear dice.
- Rolls are color coded for the stronger die.

Themes are now split into theme and mode.

- Theme determines the colors used, in some cases even replaces icons.
- Mode decides between light and dark variants, either based on your system or fixed.

## 2025-11-21 Changed UI + offline availability 🎨

The UI now uses a new base design. You will notice buttons looking differently and color themes being applied differently - for now themes no longer apply to roll results. For technical folks: the app now uses Shadcn/UI.

The app now also runs fully offline. You need to have it open for a bit while online, the app will download all required files in the background. No matter where your adventures takes you, Talis will be there with you!

## 2025-07-19 Daggerheart is coming to Talis 🎲

We are now supporting the duality dice system of Daggerheart. This is a beta for now, as we figure out what Daggerheart players need. Feedback welcome 😊
