# Changelog

## 2025-11-25 Daggerheart and more design 🎨

The Daggerheart roller is now out of beta.

- Theme colors can be used for hope and fear dice.
- Rolls are color coded for the stronger die.

Themes are now split into theme and mode.

- Theme determines the colors used, in some cases even replaces icons.
- Mode decides between light and dark variants, either based on your system or fixed.

## 2025-11-21 Changed UI + offline availability 🎨

The UI now uses a new base design. You will notice buttons looking differently and color themes being applied differently - for now themes no longer apply to roll results. For technical folks: the app now uses Shadcn/UI.

The app now also runs fully offline. You need to have it open for a bit while online, the app will download all required files in the background. No matter where your adventures takes you, Talis will be there with you!

## 2025-07-19 Daggerheart is coming to Talis 🎲

We are now supporting the duality dice system of Daggerheart. This is a beta for now, as we figure out what Daggerheart players need. Feedback welcome 😊

## 2023-12-06 D6 Roller Stable 🎉

The D6 roller is now considered stable. Check out the settings available:

- Show new results bottom or top.
- Sum all rolled dice.
- Sort dice, if you want.

## 2023-12-06 Merged Tipps page into About
