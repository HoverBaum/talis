# About

Talis is a dice rolling app developed to support multiple games or configurations of dice. It currently supports Shadowrun, D6 dice, and Daggerheart.

It's a hobby project of mine. You can find it OpenSource on [GitHub](https://github.com/HoverBaum/talis). I started this as a side project to relax, let's see where it will go.

Feel free to [reach out](https://hoverbaum.net/me#contact) 😁

## Mobile use & Offline Support

Talis is optimized for use on mobile and works fully offline as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

On mobile it will work best if used in "fullscreen" or as an installed application, as it is designed to use your entire screen. You can install it from your browser's menu or use the install button below. Once installed, Talis works completely offline - all dice rollers and features are available without an internet connection.

## Sluggish rolling

If rolling becomes sluggish, try clearing the list of results to speed the app up again. Should not happen for the first 1000 rolls or so.
