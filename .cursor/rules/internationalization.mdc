# Internationalization (i18n)

These guidelines apply to all developers and AI agents contributing to **Talis**, a Next.js app for Pen-and-Paper dice rollers.

* The app is **fully translated** in **German** and **English**.
* All user-facing strings **must be obtained from the i18n layer** (e.g. translation files or hooks), not hard-coded.
* When adding new text:

  * Provide both `en` and `de` translations.
  * Use clear, context-rich keys (`diceRoller.rollButton.label`, not `roll`).
