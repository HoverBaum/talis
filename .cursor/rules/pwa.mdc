# PWA & Offline Support

These guidelines apply to all developers and AI agents contributing to **Talis**, a Next.js app for Pen-and-Paper dice rollers.

Talis is a **fully offline-capable Progressive Web App (PWA)**:

* **Service Worker:** Automatically registered in production builds (disabled in development)
* **Offline Functionality:** All dice rollers and features work without internet connection
* **Install Prompt:** Users can install the app via install button in sidebar
* **Update Notifications:** Automatic detection and user notification when new versions are available
* **Version Display:** Current app version shown in sidebar footer
* **Offline Fallback:** Custom offline page at `app/_offline/page.tsx` for uncached routes

## Development vs Production

* **Development (`npm run dev`):** PWA features are **disabled** to prevent caching issues during development
* **Production (`npm run build && npm start`):** PWA features are **enabled** - service worker registers automatically
* **Testing:** Always test PWA features using production build locally

## PWA Configuration

* Configuration in `next.config.ts` using `@ducanh2912/next-pwa`
* Manifest file: `public/manifest.json`
* Icons: `public/icons/` (192x192 and 512x512 required)
* Service worker: Auto-generated in `public/` directory during build
