# Tech Stack

These guidelines apply to all developers and AI agents contributing to **Talis**, a Next.js app for Pen-and-Paper dice rollers.

## Tech Stack

* **Framework:** Next.js (App Router with `app/`)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
* **UI Library:** shadcn/ui
* **State Management:** Zustand (with persistence per roller)
* **Content:** MDX for docs/guides/changelogs under `pages/`
* **PWA:** `@ducanh2912/next-pwa` for offline support and Progressive Web App features

## shadcn/ui Components

* **NEVER modify files in `components/ui/**`** - These are shadcn/ui components and should remain unchanged.
* If customization is needed, create wrapper components or use composition patterns instead of modifying the base components.

> When generating code (by hand or via AI), always assume this stack and follow the conventions in the other rule files.
