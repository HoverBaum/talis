# State Management (Zustand)

These guidelines apply to all developers and AI agents contributing to **Talis**, a Next.js app for Pen-and-Paper dice rollers.

* Each roller has its **own Zustand store slice**, scoped and typed for that roller.
* State for each roller is **persisted** (e.g. last used settings and results if desired).
* Stores must use the centrally provided createStoreMiddleware.
* Store files should live close to their roller, for example:

  * `app/dice/[rollerName]/store.ts`

* When adding new state:

  * Make sure it is serializable and safe to persist.
  * Document any performance / UX constraints in the component description block or store comments.
